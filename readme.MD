# NO-FRAMEWORKS-TYPESCRIPT-APP-STARTER

This template repository contains scaffolding for web application that is going to be developed using "Vanilla" TypeScript - typescript without any frameworks

# Tools

To achieve that Webpack, with some plugins and loaders is used.
* ts-loader - loader for compiling .ts files and bundling it into bundle.js
* css-loader - loader for compiling styles , MiniCssExtractPlugin - for putting them into separate output css file
* HtmlWebpackPlugin - plugin for fetching index.html entry point from sources and putting it into output folder.

# How to install / run / build

* run `npm install` to fetch dependencies,
* run `npm start` to start local server,
* run `npm run build` to build production app - this will result in creating resources in `/dist` folder

Then you only need to update titles, description and apps to start working on your own app.
